Project Overview:
This project involved the development of a logistic regression classifier to distinguish between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) breast tissue based on images. The classifier was trained using gradient descent on a dataset containing 300 images, each annotated with ten different attributes of cell nuclei, across three statistics: mean, standard error, and worst case.
